\lettersection{About Me}

I am a self-motivated full stack developer who has comprehensive technical and management skills with proven ability to take concepts to products. I have 2 years working experience in software and web development on both windows and Linux platforms. With my solid background knowledge and efficient learning skills, I quite enjoy casually switching from different programming languages and popular frameworks. 

My long term goal is to continuously work as an enthusiastic coder in a company which has sufficient resources as well as the geek developers, who code for success of the company and changes in people's life, meanwhile seeking their achievement.

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Your Company?}

Honestly speaking, no one will refuse to work in a reputed company like yours, where they can improve skills, update ideas and start a better career. 

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Me?}
As my resume indicates, I possess more than 2 years of progressive experience in the software development field.  My professional history includes positions such as team leader at the Second Academy of China Aerospace as well as research assistant at the University of Auckland.

Most recently, my responsibilities as research assistant at the University of Auckland match the qualifications you are seeking.  As the core coder, my responsibilities included C\#, Entity Framework, scripts (bash and Perl) contributed to the successful completion of the MPAid (Maori Pronunciation Aid).  My supervisor also relied on my ability of design and code refactoring.
